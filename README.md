# 🌟 Introducing My Smart Home Automation System Project 🌟

I’m thrilled to share our recent project, a **Smart Home Automation System** designed to enhance home convenience by automating device management. 🏠

## 💡 Key Features:
- 🔹 **Device Control Interface**: Effortlessly manage devices like lights, fans, and security cameras through an intuitive console.
- 🔹 **Dynamic Status Updates**: Real-time feedback on device status—whether **ON** or **OFF**.
- 🔹 **Scalability and Customization**: Add new devices with ease, making the system highly adaptable to user needs.

## 🔧 Tech Stack:
- Developed using **C++** with a strong emphasis on **Object-Oriented Programming** principles such as:
  - Inheritance
  - Polymorphism
  - Abstraction
- Focused on creating a **practical, modular, and reusable codebase** to tackle real-world automation challenges.

## 🤝 Team Members:
This project was developed collaboratively with my teammates:
- **V Sudheer**
- **Aryan Vissamsetty**

Submitted to **Poonam Yadav** at **SRM University, AP** as part of our academic curriculum.  
It showcases our skills in **OOP**, **modular programming**, and **problem-solving**.

I’m deeply grateful to my mentors and peers for their invaluable guidance and support throughout the development process.
